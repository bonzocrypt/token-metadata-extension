## How to run this code

> Note: 
> This script is currently configured to load a local keypair file from
> your local file system at the `~/.config/solana/id.json` location 
> (which is the standard path if you have the Solana CLI installed).
> This script is also configured to use Solana devnet, therefore your
> local keypair will need devnet SOL already.

1. install the package dependencies with your favorite NodeJS package manager

```shell
yarn install
```

2. run the `./mint.ts` script using `esrun`

```shell
npx esrun ./mint.ts
```

Enjoy!
